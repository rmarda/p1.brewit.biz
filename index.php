                Hi, My name is Ruchika Marda. I live in Natick, MA. I am originally from Kolkata, India. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I work as a software engineer at MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA. Back in 2005, I had dabbled in writing JSP pages but other than that, I have no experience developing web applications. I hope to learn a lot from this class. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am experimenting with Sublime as my code editor and I like it so far. 
            </p>

    </body>
